# PikaDex

## Production source layout

The production application target is `Pokedex`, which produces `PikaDex.app`.

`Modules/` is the authoritative source tree for the reusable `PokedexCore`, `PokedexUI`, `DesignSystem`, and `PokedexResources` modules. Production feature code that is compiled directly into the application remains under `Pokedex/Feature`.

`PokedexPackages` was removed because it was not consumed by the Xcode project and contained divergent copies of the production modules and features. The Xcode targets compile the authoritative implementations directly from `Modules/`.

## Database datasets and released games

`Game` is the stable identifier stored in generated database rows. Its raw
value and `databaseIndex` are persistence contracts and must not be inferred
from declaration order. `Game.national` is an aggregate dataset with its own
generated rows; queries pass `.national` directly instead of combining rows at
runtime.

Released-game titles, generations, release groups, selector order, and
mechanics live in the `Game.releasedGameMetadata` catalog. National has no
released-game metadata. Dataset section availability is a separate policy so
National can expose authoritative aggregate rows without claiming mechanics.

Database order, selector order, and release recency are deliberately distinct:

1. `databaseIndex` and `Comparable` use stable database identity order.
2. `selectableGames` preserves the National-first selector order.
3. `releaseGroup` represents recency and allows paired releases to share a
   group; `latestReleasedGames` therefore contains both Scarlet and Violet.
4. `defaultReleasedGame` is explicit product policy and is not inferred from
   release recency.

The production build is verified with:

```sh
rtk xcodebuild build \
  -project Pokedex.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Pokedex \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'
```

The authoritative module unit tests are verified with:

```sh
rtk xcodebuild test \
  -project Pokedex.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Modules \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'
```

The legacy `PokedexTests` application test target is not included in the verified command because its model-object tests reference types that are no longer present in the production code. The target requires a separate test-modernization pass.
